Photodash is an alternative dashboard for Home Assistant with a focus on serving as a digital photo frame. It aims to be easy to configure and maintain and supports displaying local photos or images from Google Photos.

> **Note**
> Photodash is in beta and in heavy development. There will be some bugs and breaking changes, though I have waited for things to be relatively stable for an initial beta release.
